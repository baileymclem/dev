        <h3>Hi, I'm Bailey.</h3>
        <p>
            I like building things out of code. I am currently training to be a JavaScript ninja -- I stand under a
            waterfall in the mountains and ruminate on functions. I am also working on React.js, Node.js, and am
            interested in UI/UX design.
        </p>

        <p>
            February 2021, I graduated from a full-stack wev dev boot camp offered by the University of Washington in
            Seattle. There, I learned the MERN stack and decided to really dig into JavaScript development. So that's
            what I'm doing! I'm working on my skills and building my portfolio.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some facts about me:
        <ul>
            <li>I have a BA in Arts, Media, and Culture and a professional certificate in Editing✍ .</li>
            <li>I love anime -- especially magical girl anime like Sailor🌙Moon and Pretty Cure💖.</li>
            <li>I built websites🖥 for funsies when I was in high school (back in the AOL days -- I taught myself html
                and css from using view source🔎 ).</li>
            <li>In my free-time I like to play video games🎮, read📖, and study Japanese🔰.</li>
        </ul>
